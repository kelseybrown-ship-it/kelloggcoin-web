Create an ordered list (ol) with each list item (li) displaying the details of each of the 100 transactions
If the transaction is anything but the "Initial Coin Offering", i.e. the from_user of the Transaction exists (you can test this condition with something like if from_user), then display the details of the transaction (e.g. 1557 KC from Ben to Brian)
If the transaction is the "Initial Coin Offering", then display it as such (e.g. Initial coin offering: 10000 to Ben)
